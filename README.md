# AI-Powered-Medical-Diagnostics-and-Stellar-Analysis

This project implements deep learning models for real-world applications, including medical diagnostics and stellar spectrum analysis. Key highlights include:

Pneumonia Detection: Developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify chest X-rays as normal or pneumonia-infected, achieving high accuracy with efficient preprocessing pipelines.
CIFAR-10 Network Experimentation: Enhanced and optimized networks for image classification tasks using batch normalization and dropout layers for robustness.
Stellar Spectrum Analysis: Analyzed stellar spectra to predict effective star temperatures using 1D convolutional networks, achieving near-perfect accuracy on training data.
